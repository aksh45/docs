# Scripting with sails

If you want to write scripts (one off or repeating) and want to refer to the database models, sails script is a super clean way to do that. 

It is also useful for database migrations. 

If you have your environment variables defined in vs code, then ref to this - [[Lifting sails in terminal using launch.json from VS code]]

## for running the scripts in debug mode 
refer to [[debug scripts via vscode terminal]]. Set the auto attach mode to `always`
