# An opinionted stack
We made a bunch of choices regarding various parts of a web stack. Of couse there are 1000s of way to build a web stack. This is just one way, but this is one way that we found ourselves reusing again and again. The idea with switchless is to give you a set of default choices for web stack so that you dont get lost in analysis paralysis. This choice of tech stack will free up your brain space to help you focus on your business/operational requirements instead spending time deciding tech stack. 

Someday you will overgrow these default choices. You can come back and thank us then.
