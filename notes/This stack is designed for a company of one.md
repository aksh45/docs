# Company of one

If you are building a product company all by yourself, you dont have a lot of time to waste. You are writing code, talking to customer, handling operations, managing consultants. This tech stack is specifically designed for the constaints of a single person team. 

Of course, if your team is more than one person, you can still use this stack but the usabilty of the stack becomes a grey scale. At the other end of the grey scale, if you have a 100 person engineering team, you will most likely outgrow this stack or will customise it heavily. 

## Constraints of single person team
This tech stack respects the following constraints of a single person company:

- minimise switching cost
	- master one programing language
	- avoid frontend/backend complexities.. keep it simple.. keep it server rendered most of the time.
- avoid managing servers as much as possible - embrase managed services
- focus on things in this order
	- customer 
	- product 
	- reliabilty 
	- avoid fancy (fancy ui/fancy workflow - they are likely to be flaky)
	- minimise complexity
	- lesser the better
