# Export/import data using table plus

You can export a table as csv, json or sql

and then you can import it back again.. or if you export as sql, you can just run the sql to inject data in to a table. 

This is useful when you are maintaining your fixtures or when you are migrating data. Specially useful when you goof up and have to move data from one of your backup DBs
