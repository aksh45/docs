We are big fans of html forms and the way semantic styles them. Ref [semantic form documentation](https://semantic-ui.com/collections/form.html) for basic form patterns. 

The following are some advanced patterns that we use over and over again:

- [[Loader on form submit]]
- [[Checkbox in a form]]
- [[Prevent multiple form submissions by using loader on buttons]]
- [[Auto Saving Forms]]
- [[Mobile friendly filter using accordian]]
