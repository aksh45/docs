# Wordpress
Keywords:[[stack]]

For marketing pages, we usually pick between these options: 
- wordpress 
- static site generators
- sailsjs 

## Best suited for
Wordpress is best suited for marketing site, 

- you have a seperate team for marketing. 
- landing pages are not build using data from your app database. 

If you are building landing pages which displaying data from your app, we usually tend to prefer sailsjs. 

If you have non developers contributing to landing pages, then wordpress is a good fit. 

## Open source vs Hosted wordpress
Being developers, we prefer the open source verion of wordpress. The open source version is more customisable. Also multisite can make this super cost effective. 

## Multi site vs Single site
Multi site is a bit more complicated than setting up the single site. If you are someone who is working with multiple products, then running multiple wordpress server will not be cost effective.
