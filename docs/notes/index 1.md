# Templates in switchless

> this is under development

We have written process automations so many times that we end up reusing a lot of things from our previous deployments. Based on our past experience of what works, we have create two app templates.


**The two templates that switchless comes with:**

1. Web app -  for creating a full functional web app
2. API backend - for creating a worker server who does specialised tasks.
